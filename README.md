# SeAC

We are making publicly available the *Sentiment and Art Class Dataset*, abbreviated as the SeAC dataset. Main target of our work was to create an artwork database, as there are limited publicly available resources of art-driven data, for machine learning projects. **SeAC database** consists of 14 different art movements, which are namely:

- 
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-


which are representative of the art evolution during the last600 years. This specific dataset is built around art movements, whilst the majority of similar databases are structuredaround painter diversity. SeAC is an image dataset consisting of artworks (exclusively paintings) from 14th to 21stcentury. This dataset is orientated on classification of art movement and emotion recognition resulting from the sight ofa painting and consists of a total of 14644 artworks, which resulted from 140 artists. The total database consists of 14different art movements in which all art genres listed are represented with more than 1000 paintings in order to be fairlyrepresentative for each class.
