# SeAC

We are making publicly available the *Sentiment and Art Class Dataset*, abbreviated as the SeAC dataset. Main target of our work was to create an artwork database, as there are limited publicly available resources of art-driven data, for machine learning projects. **SeAC database** consists of 14 different art movements, which are namely (in alphabetical order):

- Art Nouveau
- Baroque
- Cubism
- Impressionism
- Italian Renaissance
- Mannerism - Late Rennaissance
- Northern Renaissance
- Pop Art
- Post-Impressionism
- Realism
- Rococo
- Romantism
- Street Art
- Surrealism

We made an effort to collect sufficient resources for each genre that we considered representative of the art evolution during the last 600 years, which is considered as modern-day art (after the Middle Ages). The structure of this specific dataset gives emphasis mainly in art movements, whilst the majority of similar databases are structured around painter diversity. SeAC is an image dataset consisting of artworks (exclusively paintings) from 14th to 21st century.

This dataset is orientated on machine learning projects that focus on classification of art movement and sentiment analysis (arousing of certain emotions that result from the sight of a painting). The dataset is formed from 14917 artworks in total, although we are considering an increase in art genres and labels consequently, in the near future. Total number of artists that represented in the current dataset is 140 and we tried to have the most notable for each art class (Picasso in Cubism, Van Gogh in Post-Impressionism, Salvador Dali in Surrealism, Banksy in Street Art, Andy Warhol in Pop Art, El Greco in Mannerism, Caravaggio in Baroque, etc.). As the total database consists of 14 different art movements, all art classes listed are represented with more than 1000 paintings in order to provide a fairly representative sample for each class.
